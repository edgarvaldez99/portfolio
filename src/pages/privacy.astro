      <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
      <p>

        integrate with third-party platforms, the following information may be
        collected or accessed:
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication tokens</strong> are stored securely and retained only for as long as necessary to maintain your connection to the Services. Tokens are deleted when you disconnect your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Content data</strong> (text, media) that you submit for publishing is processed and transmitted to the target platform. It is not permanently stored by the Services after successful publishing.</li>
        <li><strong>Account information</strong> (username, profile data) is retained only while your account is connected to the Services.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any personal information
        to third parties. Data is only shared with the specific third-party
        platforms you have authorized (e.g., when publishing content to your
        Instagram account, your content is sent to Instagram's API).
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        The Services implement the following security measures:

      <ul>
        <li>HTTPS encryption via Cloudflare SSL/TLS for all communications</li>
        <li>OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication (no passwords are stored)</li>
        <li>Authentication tokens are stored securely and encrypted</li>
        <li>Minimum necessary permissions (scopes) are requested from each platform</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While I strive to protect your information, no method of transmission
        over the Internet is 100% secure.
      </p>

        not knowingly collect any information from children. If you believe a
